# 0x08. Networking Basics #1

This project was done during **ALX SE Studies** at **ALX School**. The end game is to learn about what is localhost/127.0.0.1, what is 0.0.0.0, what is `/etc/hosts` and how to display the machine's active network interfaces.

## Apparatus
* Used `vi`, `vim`, and `emacs` as editor
* All files are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* All files end with a new line
* A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project
* All Bash script files are executable
* All Bash scripts pass `shellcheck` (version `0.7.0` via `apt-get`) without any error
* The first line of all Bash scripts is exactly `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
* The second line of all Bash scripts is a comment explaining what is the script doing
