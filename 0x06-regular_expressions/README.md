# 0x06. Regular expression

This project was done during **ALX SE Studies** at **ALX School**. The end game is to learn how to build a regular expression.

## Apparatus
* Used `vi`, `vim`, and `emacs` as editor
* All files are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* All files end with a new line
* A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project
* All Bash script files are executable
* The first line of all your Bash scripts is exactly `#!/usr/bin/env ruby`
* All regex is built for the Oniguruma library
