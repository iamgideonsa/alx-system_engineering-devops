# 0x04. Loops, conditions and parsing

This project was done during **ALX SE Studies** at **ALX School**. The end game is to learn about loops (`while`, `until` and `for`), condition statements (`if`, `else`, `elif` and `case`), shebangs, and how to create SSH keys with **Bash**.

## Apparatus
* Used `vi`, `vim`, `emacs` as editor
* All files are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* All files end with a new line
* A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project
* All Bash script files are executable
* Did not use `awk`
* All Bash scripts passed Shellcheck (version 0.7.0) without any error
* The first line of all your Bash scripts is exactly `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
* The second line of all Bash scripts are comments explaining what is the script doing
