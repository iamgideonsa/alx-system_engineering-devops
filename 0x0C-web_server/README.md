# 0x0C. Web server

This project was done during **ALX SE Studies** at **ALX School**. The end game is to learn about the roles of web servers and their processes (parent and child) and DNS roles.

## Tech
* Used editors: `vi`, `vim`, and `emacs`
* All files are interpreted on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
* All files end with a new line
* A `README.md` file at the root of the folder of the project
* All Bash script files are executable
* Bash script passes `Shellcheck` (version `0.3.7`) without any error
* The first line of all Bash scripts is exactly `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
* The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what is the script doing
* No `systemctl` for restarting a process
