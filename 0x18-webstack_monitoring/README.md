# `0x18. Webstack monitoring`

## `Background Context`
“You cannot fix or improve what you cannot measure” is a famous saying in the Tech industry. In the age of data-ism, monitoring how our Software systems are doing is an important thing. In this project, we will implement one of many tools to measure what is going on our servers.

Web stack monitoring can be broken down into 2 categories:
* Application monitoring: getting data about your running software and making sure it is behaving as expected
* Server monitoring: getting data about your virtual or physical server and making sure they are not overloaded (could be CPU, memory, disk, or network overload)

This project was done during **ALX SE Studies** at **ALX School**. The end game is to learn:
* Why is monitoring needed
* What are the 2 main areas of monitoring
* What are access logs for a web server (such as Nginx)
* What are error logs for a web server (such as Nginx)

## `Tech`
### `General`
* Used editors: `vi`, `vim`, and `emacs`
* All files are interpreted on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
* All files end with a new line
* A `README.md` file at the root of the folder of the project
* All Bash script files are executable
* Bash script passes `Shellcheck` (version `0.3.7`) without any error
* The first line of all your Bash scripts should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
* The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what is the script doing
